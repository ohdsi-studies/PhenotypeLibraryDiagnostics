132702000,Erythema multiforme,"Overview: Erythema multiformae (EM) is an acute, immune mediated manifestation characterized by distinctive circular target shaped skin lesions - often accompanied by erosions or bullates involving the oral, genital and/or occular mucosae. EM major is used to describe severe mucosal involvement, EM minor refers to EM without mucosal involvement. Most commonly induced by infection, commonly herpes simplex, mycoplasma pneumoniae. Can also be precipitated by drugs (NSAIDs, sulfonamides, antiepileptics, and antibiotics). EM major is considered to be distinct disease from Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) (usually a drug-induced disorder that may present with cutaneous, targetoid lesions and mucosal erosions. Atypical target lesions of SJS tend to be macular, rather than the papular lesions associated with EM). Presentation: Either after an infection or an offending drug development of multiple, sometimes spreading rashes. Assessment: Skin biopsy with staining to rule out autoimmune disease and other causes (rule out cuaneous small vessel vasculitis, bullous pemphigoid, fixed drug eruption, urticaria). Plan: If not autoimmune disease, topical steroids. If severe, systemic treatment with mycophenolate, thalidomide, immunoglobulins. Systemic corticosteroids are also used. Prognosis: self-limited, resolving within weeks without significant sequale. A subset of patients may develop recurrent EM over many years with substantial morbidity."

133444000,Thyroiditis,"Overview: diverse group of disorders characterized by some form of thyroid inflammation, causing acute or chronic, painful or painless thyroiditis. Major diagnostic criterias are dominated by presence of pain and tenderness. Pain and tenderness occurs with subacute thyroiditis with unregulated thyroid hormone level fluctuations - includes de Quervains, subacute granulomatous - thought to post viral illness. Infectious thyroiditis is also painful and tender and may be acute - e.g. bacterial with abscess suppurative, or chronic infection. Pain and tenderness is absense in silent/lymphocytic/painless thyroiditis that may occur secondary to autoimmune causes (hashimotos). Postpartum thyroiditis is known to occur within 1 year of parturition - and history of pregnancy is an important classifier. Drugs like interferon alfa, interleukin-2, amiodarone, lithium, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, check point inhibitors immunotherapy may cause painless non tender thyroiditis. Presentation: Painful thyroiditis has obvious symptoms of pain in thyroid region, seasonality (summer) in pattern may exist because etiology is commonly thought to be post viral. Painless thyroiditis have history of hyperthyroidism like symptoms followed by hypothyroidism - however rarely are these symptoms severe, and are almost always transient many go undetected. Assessment: TSH followed by T3 and T4. Physical exam to confirm tenderness. Subacute/acute thyroiditis is a clinical diagnosis. Medication review, anti thyroid antibodies, thyroid ultrasound. Plan: Find and treat underlying cause of thyroid inflammation (medications, surgery). Beta blockers for bothersome thyroiditis. If symptomatic hypothyroidism, consider T4 (levothyroxine) therapy. Pain management if needed. Prognosis: Typically excellent prognosis."

201820000,Diabetes Mellitus,Overview: Presentation: Assessment: Plan: Prognosis:
201965000,Shock,"Overview: Four types of non mutually exclusion shocks are recognized: distributive (septic, non septic - anaphylatic, neurogenic, SIRS), cardiogenic (cardiomyopathic - MI, arrythomogenic, mechanical), hypovolemic (hemorrhagic, non-hemorrhagic - diarrhoea, vomiting), and obstructive (pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, constrictive pericarditis). Cardiogenic shock is a subtype of shock phenotype where there is inability of the heart to pump an adequate amount of blood leading to decreased oxygen and nutrient delivery to the tissues and, if tissue perfusion reduction is prolonged, potentially end-organ damage and multi-system failure. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) with left ventricular failure is the most common cause of cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock is the leading cause of death in patients with acute MI. Cardiogenic shock has persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure <80 to 90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure 30 mmHg lower than baseline) with severe reduction in the cardiac index (<1.8 L/min per m2 without support or <2 to 2.2 L/min per m2 with support) with adequate filling pressures. Other causes of cardiogenic shock include acute mitral valve regurgitation, rupture of ventricular septal or free walls, cardiac tamponade. Septic shock is a subtype of shock phenotype with distributive type of shock. SIRS is a clinical syndrome that is characterized by a robust inflammatory response to infectious (or non infectious) insult. Sepsis, defined as a dysregulated host response to infection resulting in life-threatening organ dysfunction. There is a continuum of severity ranging from sepsis to septic shock. Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome is a type of sepsis and a type of septic shock. Presentation: The cardinal features of shock, irrespective of shock type, include clinical manifestations of hypoperfusion such as hypotension (which occurs in most patients), oliguria, abnormal mental status, cold clammy skin, and evidence of metabolic acidosis on laboratory testing. The ""classic"" patient with cardiogenic shock has severe systemic hypotension, signs of systemic hypoperfusion (eg, cool extremities, oliguria, and/or alteration in mental status), and respiratory distress due to pulmonary congestion. Shock is a physiologic continumm that begins with inciting event that triggers physiological changes. Pre-shock/compensated shock is characterized by compensatory responses to diminished tissue perfusion - tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction, elevated systemic blood pressure. Shock - compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed, organ dysfunction may start with dyspnea, restlessnes, diaphoresis, metabolic acidosis, hypotension. End-organ dysfunction including anuria, acute renal failure, acidemia, comma, death. Cardiogenic shock presentation is similar to other forms of shock (see shock phenotype) along with evidence of myocardial insult to explain the shock such as MI. Most patients who develop cardiogenic shock due to acute MI do so after hospital admission for MI because of eventual failure of intial compensatory mechanisms that protected the individual from hemodynamic failure with about 50% developing within 24 hours of infarct. Sepsis shock may be expected to have sepsis symptoms such as fever, tachycardia, elevated respiratory rate, abnormal white blood count, and severely ill looking. Assessment: find the cause, evaluate for septic or cardiogenic or other causes. Diagnosis of cardiogenic shock requires strong clinical judgment by looking for some combination of difficulty breathing, hypotension, hypoperfusion, pulmonary congestion - supported by ECG abnormalality, chest x ray with pulmonary congestion, and wall motion abnormality on echocardiogram. To identify infection in suspected sepsis - blood/urine/sputum cultures, wound cultures if a wound present, lumbar puncture if indicated clinically,lactate level. Plan: Treat as emergency. ICU admission, hemodynamic monitoring with pulmonary artery catheterization if needed, vasopressor drugs (norepinephrine, dopamine), supplemental oxygen/ventilatory support, pH managment of lactic acidosis. Treat the cause. Cardiogenic shock- diagnostic coronary angiography, attempt reperfusion of heart if MI, coronary artery revascularization. fluid replenishment, hemodynamic monitoring and management, airway management and ventillation. For sepsis - may need to start with broad spectrum antibiotics after cultures are drawn (even when pending), and then narrow antibiotics based on results of susceptibility testing. Prognosis: highly variable. Cardiogenic shock - early revascularization has better prognosis."
24609000,Hypoglycemia,"Overview: A condition in which blood sugar (glucose) level is lower than normal. A fasting blood sugar of 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or below should serve as an alert for hypoglycemia (some people can be asymptomatic). Hypoglycemia is often related to diabetes treatment. Presentation: Fatigue, pale, shakiness, sweating, anxieety, hunger, irritability (as hypoglycemia worses the syptmos get worse - confusion, visual disturbances, seizures, loss of consciousnessAssessment: blood glucose meter, or blood glucose level Plan: Involves quickly getting the glucose level back to normal either with high-sugar foods or drinks or with medications. Glucose tablets, glucose gel, Glucagon (if severe), changing diabetic medsPrognosis: Hypoglycemia is considered severe if you need help from someone to recover. Long-term treatment requires identifying and treating the cause of hypoglycemia."
254443000,Sjögren's syndrome,"Overview: Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that is characterized by diminished lacrimal and salivary gland function. Primary form of SS occurs in isolation, while secondary forms maybe a complication or overlap with other rheumatic conditions, most commonly rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Presentation: Sjogren’s syndrome is commonly associated with dryness and its sequela, pruritus, and in severe forms it may have extraglandular manifestations. Assessment: SS is suspected based on symptoms of persistent dry eyes, mouth, parotid gland enlargement, unexplained dental caries. Nonspecific but supportive of diagnosis are abnormal results of serologic tests - anti-Ro/SSA antibodies with or without anti-La/SSB antibodies. There is no single diagnostic test for SS. Plan: Ameliorate symptoms, prevent dryness related mucosal complicationsPrognosis: Chronic lifelong when not managed leads to reduced quality of life. With good management, DM induced end organ damage such as chronic kidney disease may be reduced."
255573000,Chronic obstructive lung disease,"Overview: COPD is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common conditions that contribute to COPD.

255848000,Pneumonia,"Overview: Pneumonia is acute infection of pulmonary parenchyma. It is commonly dividied into two categories based on source of infection into Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) - most common and nosocomial (hospital) acquired pneumonia. Presentation: cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and sputum. Leukocytosis, consolidation/interstial infiltrates on chest X-ray. Atypical pneumonia (mycoplasma pneumonia have milder presentation with cough)Assessment: history of hospitalization to determine if noscomial pneumonia. Determine the need to hospitalize vs outpatinet management. Plan: targeted antimicrobials after isolating pathogen is preferred, but rarely practical. Blood cultures may be positive in many hospitalized. S. pneumoniae is most common bacterial, while Influenza is common for viral pneumonia. Prognosis: treatment may lead to good recovery"
257628000,Systemic lupus erythematosus,"Overview: is a chronic autoimmune disease of unknown cause that can affect virtually any organ of the body with the production of antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Presentation: wide variations from mild joint/skin disease to life threatening multiorgan failure. There is a no pathognomonic feature. Constitutional symptoms of fatigue, fever is common. Mucocutaneous symptoms of such as butterfly rash are commonly described. Arthritis occurs in most of the patients. Assessment: Diagnosis requires clinical judgment and is based on presenting symptoms, clinician should exclude all other differential diagnosis, along with supportive laboratory finding of ANA positivity. There are multiple diagnostic aids (criteria). ANA negative lupus has been recognized. Plan: Several non-pharmacologic therapies has been proposed. Hydroxychloroquine is commonly used. Immunosuppressive therapy including methylprednisone, azathioprine is used in acute exacerbations. Belimumab is approved for use in SLE by FDA. Prognosis: The disease course involves unpredictable flares and remissions. This is a lifelong chronic disease that may progress to multi organ failure with some known prognostic indicators such as young age at onset, preexisting renal disease, race etc."
312939000,Thromboangiitis obliterans,"Overview: Previously known as Buerger's disease, TAO is characterized by a nonatherosclerotic (not due to cholesterol plaque), segmental inflammatory thrombotic vessel occlusions, that affects the small to medium-sized arteries and veins of the extremities (upper and lower). It is distinguished pathologically from other forms of vasculitis by a highly cellular, inflammatory intraluminal thrombus but no fibrinoid necrosis and the presence of an intact internal elastic membrane. Although smoking is important to the pathogenesis, the specific etiologic mechanism remains unknown. Inflammatory, immunologic, and endothelial factors play a role. Most common in young tobacco and marijuana smokers. Presentation: Ischemia of the distal extremities (fingers/toes/hands/feet), ischemic digit ulcers or digit gangrene. In people typically younger than age 45 years, the condition is distinguished from other forms of vasculitis by a highly cellular, inflammatory intraluminal thrombus with relative sparing of the vessel wall and, more specifically, sparing of the internal elastic lamina. Although distal vessel involvement causes distal ischemia in other vasculitides, serologic markers are negative in thromboangiitis obliterans. Assessment: Painful ulceration or ischemia of part or all of fingers/toes due to lack of blood supply not reversible with heat. Allen test (to evaluate for blood flow in the radial and ulnar artery) should be performed - if positive in the wrist of a young smoker is highy predictive of TAO. CBC, CMP, UA, serologies for sed rate, CRP, ANA, RF, complement, cryoglobulins, hyprecoagulability test, toxicology (cocaine, amphetamine, cannabis). Plan: Tobacco and/or marijuanna cessation. Calcium channel blockers, IV prostaglandins or phosphodiesterase inhibitorss to vasodilate. Interventional revascularization.

Assessment: sleep history, overnight monitoring at a sleep center (Nocturnal polysomnography)Plan: lifestyle changes, Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral appliances (keeping the throat open), surgery. Prognosis: Can be diagnosed and treated."
313800000,Thrombotic microangiopathy,"Overview: TMA is potentially life threatening condition due to abnormalities in the vessel wall of arterioles and capillaries leading to microvascular thrombosis. It almost always leads to microagniopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia - but MAHA and thrombocytopenia may be caused by several other conditions. Before making diagnosis of TMA, other systemic disorders that can cause MAHA and thrombocytopenia need to be excluded including - HELLP syndrome, systemic malignanices, sepsis and systemic infections, systemic rheumatic disorders like SLE, systemic sclerosis, stem cell or organ transplant, DIC etc. TMA is classified into two main types, Primary TMA (heriditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura TTP, acquired TTP, shiga toxin mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome (ST-HUS), drug-induced TMA (DITMA) sydrome, complement-mediated TMA. DITMA is an acquired condition resulting from exposure to a drug (eg, medication, other substance) that induces formation of drug-dependent antibodies or causes direct tissue toxicity that results in the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in small arterioles or capillaries. Presentation: Common initial presentations include unexplained anemia or thrombocytopenia, unexplained neurologic findings (suspected stroke or transient ischemic attack), or other acute illness. Diarrhoes if ST-HUS. Assessment: peripheral smear to confirm anemia, hemolysis and/or thrombocytopenia. Tissue biopsy (usually of kidney) is required for pathologic diagnosis, but clinical diagnosis is commonly performed by the observation of microagniopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia. LDH, evaluate for shiga toxin (especially in the presence of hemolytic uremic syndrome), serum creatinine, urine output daily. Exclude other systemic disorder (HELLP). Plan: Treatment of underlyng condition, plasma exchange, or anti-complement therapy. revascularization for cardiac microangiopathy. platelet transfusion for severe thrombocytopenia, red blood cell transfusion for severe anemia. Prognosis: Poor in the absence of therapy, including myocardial ischemia, renal failure."
316139000,Heart failure,"Overview: For use of generic term, 'heart failure' consider the cohort definition for 'acute decompensated left heart failure' that is managed as an emergency. The other cohort definition options include chronic stable compensated left heart failure, corpulmonale (right heart failure) with pulmonary hypertension. Heart Failure is a clinical syndrome of dyspnea, fatigue and fluid retention because of the inability of the heart to pump sufficient blood to meet the metabolic demands of peripheral tissues, or ability to do so only at abnormally high cardiac filling pressures. Classified in many ways, low output vs high output cardiac failure, left-side vs right-side cardiac failure, backward vs forwad cardiac failure, systolic vs diastolic cardiac failure, based on ejection fraction (< 40%, 40 to 49%, >= 50% HF with presevered ejection fraction), functional level (Class 1 to 4 - symptoms at rest). Congestive heart failure is left-sided heart failure and is associated with pulmonary edema. Presentation: From pulmonary edema such as Progressive dyspnea, paroxysmal noctural dysnpnea, orthopnea, abdominal or peripheral congestion/edema, tiredness, dizziness. In some cases of chronic compensated heart failure, the patient may be asymptomatic. Assessment: Evaluate the cause (including precipitating cause if acute on chronic) with extensive investigation on incident acute heart failure. BNP, ProBNP, ECG, ECHO to measure ejection fraction and wall motion abnormalities, CXR, catheterization, stress test, sleep study etc. Assess grade based on NYHA. Plan: depends on the type of cardiac failure. Congestive heart failure - diuresis, morphine, nitrates, oxygen NIV, position. For low perfusion - inotropes, mechanical support. In addition care cordination and cardiac rehabilitation, goal of treatment is to improve quality of life and reduce hospitalization, slow progression. Diuretics, beta blockers, ACE-/ARBs are part of initial therapy. Manage complications such as arrythmia with need for defibrillator and anticoagulants, heart transplant. Prognosis: depends on grade, progression and presence of complications. Life long chronic disease. If well managed, can lead to compensated aymptomatic state."

Elevated or increased blood pressure (BP); High blood pressure; Hypertension (HTN); Systemic hypertension. Primary (essential) hypertension and Seconday hypertension (caused by and underlying condition). Presentation: No signs and symptoms. can have headaches, SOB or nosebleeds (these occur when blood pressure reaches a severe stage). Assessment: Stage 1 HTN - systolic pressure ranging from 130 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic pressure ranging from 80 to 89 mm Hg; and Stage 2 - systolic pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or a diastolic pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher. 2 - 3 BP readings each at three or more separate appointments before diagnosing. Plan: Lifestyle, medications - Thiazide diuretics, Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, alpha-beta blockers (many other meds). Prognosis: If untreated, it can cause health conditions, such as heart disease and stroke."
318443000,Arteriosclerotic vascular disease,"Overview: is an arteriopathy from atherosclerosis, that may begin at childhood with the development of fatty streaks. Fibrous cap, plaque form as the lesion advances. Presentation: Coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, cerebral vascular disease. Assessment: depends on the symptoms and vessels involved. Dyslipidemia testingPlan: lifestyle changes, diet and excercise, statins, anticouagulant cholesterol meds, coronary stent, angioplastyPrognosis: chronic disease, rarely reversible unless very early, progressive in the presence of risk factors. may lead to end organ damage thru ischemic stroke."
318736000,Migraine,"Overview: Migraine disorders are classes of debilitating, severe headaches with other physical symptoms. Prevalence has been estimated that 10-15% of all patients worldwide experience a migraine disorder at some point. Presentation: Symptoms include severe headaches, nausea, sensitivity to light an irritability. Two broad categories exist; those with and without visual auras. Gender appears to be a strong component, where women are approximately 3 times more likely to report migraines than men and reported symptoms are also more severe. Assessment: There is no formal diagnostic test for migraines. Diagnosis is achieved by reviewing family and patient medical history, physical examination and performing investigations to rule out other causes of the symptoms. A migraine disorder is classed as chronic when symptoms persist for >=15 days in a calendar month. Plan: Standard pain medication such as ibuprohen or acetaminophen is suggested for initial treatment. Triptans or ergotamines are suggested where simple pain medication does not help. There is no cure or widely accepted treatment thought to prevent most causes of migraine. Prognosis: Migraine disorders are debilitating conditions that have no clear path of treatment with many patients having problems throughout their lives."

321052000,Peripheral vascular disease,"Overview: Peripheral vascular disease is peripheral artery disease (PAD) i.e. vascular here refers to artery and not venous or lymphatic disease. Peripheral here represents noncoronary vasculature and the underlying disease is limited to atherosclerotic disease causing peripheral artery obstruction. aka- arteriosclerosis obliterans, arterial insufficiency of the legs, claudication, and intermittent claudication. Lower limb ischemia is the most common subtype. Different from Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease) and Raynaud phenomenon (RP, idiopathic, immune mediated) that are non atherosclerotic and distinct. Also distinct of vessel disease that may lead to ischemia such as arterial aneurysm, dissection, embolism etc. Presentation: Intermittent claudication pain beginning after age 40 years. Severe disease may lead ischemic rest pain. Non healing ulcers may be observed in extreme cases. Reduced hair growth on legs, skin color changes (reddish blue or pale), weak pulses (in legs and feet) are seen.

Plan: Lifestyle changes - tobacco cessation, exercise, and a healthy diet. Medications (cilostazol or pentoxifylline, clopidogrel, aspirin, statins, ACE inhibitors), angioplasty or vascular surgery. Prognosis: No cure. PVD responds to lifestyle treatments and medications as needed."
321319000,Cardiomyopathy,"Overview: Cardiomyopathies were originally defined as disorders that were idiopathic, but in North American clinical practice the terms ""ischemic,"" ""valvular,"" and ""hypertensive cardiomyopathy"" were commonly used causing dismbiguation. Multiple attempts were made including2006 AHA scientific statement definition ""Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases of the myocardium associated with mechanical and/or electrical dysfunction that usually (but not invariably) exhibit inappropriate ventricular hypertrophy or dilation and are due to a variety of causes that frequently are genetic. Cardiomyopathies either are confined to the heart or are a part of generalized systemic disorders, often leading to cardiovascular death or progressive heart failure-related disability."" Two groups: primary cardiomyopathies (predominantly involving the heart) and secondary cardiomyopathies (accompanied by other organ system involvement). The primary cardiomyopathies are subdivided into genetic, mixed (predominantly nongenetic), or acquired (nongenetic). The genetic cardiomyopathies include Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D), left ventricular noncompaction, PRKAG2 and Danon glycogen storage diseases, conduction defects, mitochondrial myopathies, and ion channel disorders. The mixed cardiomyopathies include Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). The acquired cardiomyopathies include myocarditis, stress-induced (takotsubo), peripartum, tachycardia-induced, and infants of insulin-dependent diabetic mothers. This was followed in 2008 by ESC, as ""A myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to explain the observed myocardial abnormality"". The clinical ideas describing the breadth of cardiomyopathy is still evolving but functionally echocardiogram evaluation is a functional way to classify cardiomyopathy into either dilated, hypertrophic, arrhythmogenic right ventricular, or restrictive cardiomyopathy. Systolic dysfunction is characterized by a decrease in myocardial contractility, i.e. myocardial contractility is decreased globally and commonly compensated thru LV enlargementi.e. dilated cardiomyopathy. Diastolic dysfunction refers to cardiac dysfunction in which LV relaxation and filling is abnormal and is accompanied by elevated filling pressures (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, LV noncompaction), valvular heart disease, pericardial disease. Some cardiac disorders may present as more than one type of cardiomyopathy e.g. amyloid cardiomyopathy with both hypertrophic and restrictive. Cardiac sarcoidosis with wall motion abnormality and ventricular arrythmias. DCM, with Left ventricular cavity dilatation, is associated with viruses and gene mutations. some definitions exclude ischemic cardiomyopathy which appears similar to DCM. In general HCM, would not include pathologic hypertrophy secondary to pathologic loading conditions such as hypertension and valve disease. Atheletes heart, i.e. physiologic cardiomyopathy is not considered cardiomyopathy. RCM is characterized by nondilated ventricles with impaired ventricular filling, commonly without muscle hypertrophy but wall may appear thick because of infiltrative disease (amyloidosis) or storage disease (Fabry). Stress Cardiomyopathy, aka apical ballooning syndrome, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, broken heart syndrome, and stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is a type of acquired cardiomyopathy characterized by transient regional systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV), mimicking myocardial infarction, but in the absence of angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease or acute plaque rupture. In most cases of stress cardiomyopathy, the regional wall motion abnormality extends beyond the territory perfused by a single epicardial coronary artery. Presentation: Cardiomyopathy may present with broad set of signs and symptoms including fatigure, dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, presyncope and syncope and depends on whether the person is functional vs decompensated. Assessment: ECG often with QTc prolongation greather than 500 ms; ecocardiogram, urgent coronary angiography (for this diagnosis, there needs to be an absence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease). Troponin and BNP or proBNP serial levels. Plan: Highly personalized care. Manage heart failure, arrythmias, rehabilitation, education. Anticoagulation sometimes indicated. Prognosis: depends on degree of damage. Many with HCM may have normal life expectancy. Prognosis: worse with older age and abnormal left heart pump function (LVEF<40%). Risk of sudden cardiac death. May benefit from cardiac transplantation."
36712702000,Preterm birth,"Overview: Prematurity is defined as a birth that occurs before 37 completed weeks (less than 259 days) of gestation. Delivery of the fetus between 20 and 37 weeks of gestation. Majority of PTB are spontaneous - due to preterm labor or preterm prelabor rupture of membranes. PTB is relatively common at upto 20%. Reproductive history of PTB is a major risk factor for recurrence. Presentation: Rupture of membranes (amniotic sac), contractions of uterus, dilation of cervix and delivery of infant. Sometimes a cesearean section is needed to deliver the fetus prematurely for medical reasons e.g fetal distress. Assessment: If in labor - speculum exam to confirm amniotic fluid, serial cervical exams, ultrasound to confirm presentation and plan for delivery or need for C section. Plan: If possible treat mother with corticosteroids to promote fetal lung maturity and reduced risk of respiratory distress post delivery; but very few interventions have proven successful in prolonging pregnancy period after labor has started. Treat any identified infections; magnesium sulfate as tocolytic. Prognosis: The less mature the fetus, in general the poorer prognosis. 20 weeks gestation considered the lower limit of survivability."

37436000,Disorder of optic nerve,"Overview: optic nerve connects retinal ganglion cells to visual nuclei, and is considered an extension of CNS and not a peripheral nerve with four segments (intraocular/optic disc, intraorbial, optic foramen, intracranial part. Presentation: optic nerve lesions produce monocular visual loss usually associated with afferent pupillary defect, central vision loss (scotoma), dyschromatopsia, papillitis/optic neuritis, optic atrophy. Optic neuritis ON (in young) and ischemic optic neuropathy ION (older, > 50) are two most common optic nerve disease. Anterior ION (optic disc) & Posterior ION (retrobulbar). Nonarteritic ION is the most common ION, and can be AION or PION. AION is common with giant cell arteritis and > 70 yr. Optic neuritis is an inflammatory, demyelinating condition that is highly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), some ON are associated with infections - west nile, cat scratch, toxoplasmosis or may be a complication of meningitis, or vasculitis. Postviral optic neuritis has been associated with measles, mumps, chickenpox, influenza, and Epstein-Barr virus, typically follow clinical infection by 1 to 3 weeks - more common in children and often bilateral. Bilateral ON may occur in GB syndrome. Sarcoidosis may be associated with ON - often bilateral. Chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION)is rare, relapsing autoimmune optic neuritis without know causes like sarcoidosis, lupus, MS, etc. Compressive optic neuropathies are slowly progressing vision loss due to compression from neoplasia or other mass in region. ON may be genetic - Leber and Kjer's. Drugs and toxins may cause ON - e.g ethambutol, and potentially infliximab, sildenafil, amiodarone. Presentation: maybe acute, sub-acute or chronic and is different based on etiology. NION is commonly acute, monoocular, painless visual loss with optic disc swelling. ON is acute, painful, monocular visual loss in younger (18 to 40 y) - that evolves over several days. Assessment: opthalmologic exam and MRI is usually essential. Gadolinimum MRI shows lesion in 90% of ON, but does not show in ION. Plan: no effective treatment for ION. ON may be management with methylprednisolone. Prognosis: IONs have poor prognosis compared to ON."

377091000,Seizure,"Overview: A seizure is a sudden change in behavior, movements or feelings, or levels of consciousness caused by electrical hypersynchronization of neuronal networks in the cerebral cortex. There are three subtypes : Acute symptomatic seizure refers to a seizure that occurs at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult; Unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure of unknown etiology as well as one that occurs in relation to a preexisting brain lesion or progressive nervous system disorder; Epilepsy (or epilepsy syndrome) - Two or more distinct unprovoked seizure > 24 hours apart, or a tendency to have recurrent seizures is epilepsy. Seizures are either focal or generalized (various types), or unknown onset. Most seizures can be categorized as either focal or generalized according to whether the onset of electrical activity involves a focal region of the brain or both sides of the brain simultaneously. Presentation: mild to severe, temporary confusion, staring spell, uncontrollable jerking movements of arms/legs, loss of awareness/consciousness, cognitive or emotional symptoms, such as fear, anxiety or deja vu. Assessment: is to determine if cause of seizure because of a systemic insult (i.e. potentially reversible e.g. metabolic derangements, drug or alcohol withdrawal) or an intrinsic dysfunction of the central nervous system (i.e. underlying brain pathology and long-term). The later is also commonly unprovoked seizures. Compared with children and young adults, older adults with a first seizure are more likely to have a cause of seizure identified by an initial evaluation and neuroimaging.. Review symptoms and hx of seizures; neuro exam, blood samples for infections, genetic conditions, blood sugar level and any electrolyte imbalances, lumbar puncture, EEG, CT, MRI, PET, Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). Plan: anti-seizure medications (if more than one seizure); if meds do not work - surgery, vagus nerve stimulation, other types of neurostimulations. Prognosis: Can achieve good seizure control with medication. Impacts daily life, need personal safety."

Memantine, an N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, is prescribed to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. Prognosis: Worsens over time, progressive disease. No cure exists, but medications and management strategies may temporarily improve symptoms. Symptoms eventually grow severe enough to interfere with daily tasks."
381114000,Microcephalus,"Overview: When a fetus or infant's head circumference is smaller than expected when compared to others of the same gestational age, sex and ethnic background. Presentation: Observation of small head circumference by ultrasound prior to birth. Small head circumference measured with tape measure after birth. Assessment: Head circumference measured after birth 2 standard deviations below the mean or <3rd percentile according to gestational age and gender. When diagnosed prior to birth, ultrasound at 24 weeks or later for a gestation with confirmed dates 2 SD below mean or <3rd percentile using standardized reference charts for the population. Must be confirmed by a second ultrasound at least 1 week after the first ultrasound. Plan: Prenatally, close ultrasound follow up of growth of fetus, delivery if needed, After delivery, early intervention services and developmental pediatric consult if patient fails to meet developmental milestones. Prognosis: Normal development to developmental delay to death depending on cause and severity of the microcephaly."
381270000,Parkinson's disease,"Overview: A disorder of the central nervous system that affects movement, often including tremors. Parkinson's disease occurs when nerve cells, or neurons, in an area of the brain that controls movement become impaired and/or die. Nerve cell damage in the brain causes dopamine levels to drop, leading to the symptoms of Parkinson's. Progression is defined by 5 stages (Hoehn and Yahr Scale). Presentation: Shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination - begin gradually and get worse over timeAssessment: No specific test exists to diagnose. Medical history, review of signs and symptoms, and neurological and physical exam Plan: Levodopa (L-dopa) and Carbidopa; dopamin agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, anticholinergics, COMT inhibitors, antiviral; deep brain stimulation; physical, occupational, and speech therapiesPrognosis: No cure. Symptoms may worsen as the disease progresses."
381591000,Cerebrovascular disease,"Overview: Cerebrovascular disease (subsumes cerebrovascular accident) are a group of conditions that affect the cerebral vasculature and blood flow, resulting in or predisposing to cerebrovascular accident/stroke (includes vascular anomalies - both congenital and acquired , av malformations, capillary telangiectasia etc). A stroke (cerebrovascular accident) is a highly variable clinical condition (clinical diagnosis supported by testing) defined as abrupt onset of a neurologic deficit that is attributatble to a focal vascular cause (i.e. cerebrovascular disease). Cerebral ischemia is caused by reduction in blood flow to brain tissue for more than a few seconds - because neurons lack glycogen, energy failure rapidly ensures and neurologic symptoms manifest in seconds. If cessation of blood flow lasts for more than a few minutes - cerebral infarction (brain tissue death) may occur. If blood supply is restored before infarction, full recovery is possible - transient ischemic attack (TIA). TIA is defined as all neurologic signs and symptoms resolved within 24hr without evidence of brain infarction on brain imaging (most < 1hr). Stroke is said to have occurrred if the neurologic signs and symptoms persist for > 24hr or brain infarction is seen on imaging. A generalized reduction in cerebral blood flow (e.g. systemic hypotension due to arrythmia, myocardial infarction) usually produces syncope, and if long enough may lead to globa hypoxia-ischemia encephalopathy - this is not stroke because it is not focal vascular disease. Stroke syndrome may occur because of focal ischemia/infarction (obstruction of vessel) or intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding into or around brain with ischemic neurologic symptoms secondary to mass effect, increased intracranial pressure or toxins). Seizure, intracrainal tumor, migraine, metabolic encephalopathy may mimic stroke - but is not stroke. Stroke syndromes are divided (based on vasculature) into - large-vessel stroke within anterior circulation (internal carotid artery and branches - middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, anterior choroidal artery, internal carotid artery, common carotid artery), large-vessel stroke within posterior circulation (basillar artery, vertebral artery, internal cerebellar artery), small-vesssel disease(old name lacunar stroke) of either vascular bed. Ischemic penumbra - tissue around core area of infarction with reversible ischemia. Thrombotic (ischemic) strokes are those in which the pathologic process giving rise to thrombus formation in an artery produces a stroke either by reduced blood flow distally (low flow) or by an embolic fragment that breaks off and travels to a more distant vessel (artery-to-artery embolism). Embolic strokes are divided into four categories (known cardiac source, possible cardiac or aortic source, arterial source, unknown source). Hemorrhagic stroke are classifed based on location - intracranial hemorrhage (ICH - parenchymal hemorrhage), subdural and epidural hemorrhage (later two mostly due to trauma induced vessel damage). Intracranial hemorrhage is divided into hypertensive ICH (commonly spontaneous rupture of small artery) or large lobar hemorrhage (e.g. temporal hemorrhage). Presentation: Highly variable. stroke - facial droop, arm weakness, speech difficulty. headache, vertigo, N/V, confusion, arm/leg/face numbness, difficult to walk. Small vessel ischemic stroke usually present as pure motor hemoiparesis, pure sensory stroke, ataxic hemiparesis, dyarthria and clumsy limbs. Hemorrhagic stroke is more commonly associated with headache, ischemic stroke is more commonly with seizures. Assessment: the goal is to establish clinical diagnosis and evaluate if hemorrhage or ischemia, so that treatment plan may be initiated. CT head is highly sensitive for hemorrhagic stroke. Initial management does not depend on etiology - establishin etiology helps prevent recurrence. TOAST classification (5 subtypes) is commonly used to establish etiology of ischemic stroke. Histpry & physical, angiogram, ultrasound, CT, EEG, lumbar puncture, MRI. Review history of anticoagulation and need for reversal. Plan: ABC resusciation first. Goal is to prevent or reverse brain injury. Medical support (BP management), IV thrombolysis, endovascular revascularization, antithrombotic therapy (aspirin), neuroprotection, stroke center referal and rehabilitation. Prognosis: can highly impacted by management especially acute management of stroke. After acute management, risk of recurrence needs to be reduced and any long-term sequela addressed through rehabilitation."
4013643000,Pulmonary arterial hypertension,"Overview: PAH is one of the five subtypes of Pulmonary hypertension. The diagnosis requires exclusion of other subtypes of PH such as those due to left heart disease, chronic lung disease involving hypoxemia, ventous themobembolic pulmonary artery obstruction and miscelaneous causes of PH. Idiopathic and heritable PAH are clinically indistinguishable but genetic tests may help distinguish the two. The following conditions are assosicated with PAH - connective tissue disorders (systemic sclerosis/scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erytematous, raynaud disease, mixed connective tissue disease). Also associated with HIV, Portal hypertension, congential heart disease with shunts, schistosomiasis. Presentation: often a manifestation of underlying etiology, the presentations are progressive exertional dyspnea and fatigure. Assessment: Non invasive (EKG, Echocardiogram) to invasive hemodynamic test (right heart catheterization) to establish diagnosis and find etiology. Plan: Treat underlying cause where possible. Improve breathing. O2 therapy, anticoagulants, calcium channel blockers, prostaglandins, possible for a lung transplant or septostomy. Heritable PAH is confirmed if two or more family members have PAH or if a BMPR2 gene mutation or mutation in another gene known to cause PAH is identified in the affected person. Prognosis: Chronic, can last for years or be lifelong. Life-threatening condition that gets worse over time, but treatments can help the symptoms."

4028363000,Uveitis,"Overview: Intraocular inflammation, characterized by inflammation of the uvea. Uvea is the middle portion of the eye that extends from the iris, ciliary body to the choroidPresentation: nonspecific and variable with symptoms in the eye such as visual loss, pain, redness. On examination there may be signs of leukocytes in the eye chamber. Assessment: needs ophthalmological evaluation of eye chamber. Plan: should be managed with urgency to prevent complications, preferably start treatment within 24 hours. Treatment is dependent on the cause, e.g. viral infections require antiviral medication, while noninfectious causes may include steroids, immunosuppressive agents or biologics (infliximab, adalimumab). Prognosis: If untreated may lead to complications in eye such as keratopathy, synechiae, cataract etc."
4030518000,Renal impairment,"Overview: Renal impairment is decreased kidney function measured as decreased glomerular filtration rate (estimated eGFR using serum creatinine) that may be reversible or irreversible. Kidney damage refers to pathologic abnormalities, whether established via kidney biopsy or imaging studies, or inferred from markers such as urinary sediment abnormalities or increased rates of urinary albumin excretion. Acute Kidney Injury (formerly known as acute renal failure) is a type of organ failure (usually reversible) that is almost always because of pre-renal or renal (acute tubular necrosis) etiology, and is diagnosed by a criteria that is a combination of either increase in serum creatine (laboratory) or severe reduction in urine volume. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a heterogeneous group of common chronic disorders characterized by alterations in kidney structure and function, which a range of severity manifestation that depend on the underlying cause and rate & degree of loss of kidney function. CKD is defined by the presence of kidney damage or decreased kidney function for three or more months, irrespective of the cause, and this persistence of the damage or decreased function for at least three months is necessary to distinguish CKD from acute kidney disease. History of kidney transplantation even if normal kidney function is CKD. The term ""end-stage kidney disease"" (ESKD) generally refers to chronic kidney failure treated with either dialysis or transplantation. Presentation: Acute Kidney injury due to prerenal causes have symptoms of reduced urine output associated with decreased tissue perfusion insults (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoes, bleeding, sepsis that have lead to volume depletion, hypotension), while those due to renal causes such as exposure to nephrotoxins including drugs that may have blood and sediments in urine, with tachycardia and signs of uremia. Chronic Kidney Disease is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, as symptoms appear in later stages of disease or secondary to complications. In some cases patient may be diagnosed with CKD, when an asymptomatic CKD decompensates and manifests as acute (exacerbation of chronic) kidney disease. CKD disease is commonly recognized by hormonal and metabolic complications such as anemia and hyperparathyroidism, as the symptoms and signs are non-specific such as fatigue, hypertension, electrolyte imbalances, dyspnea and abnormal heart rhythm. Assessment: Establish if acute or chronic. If acute, look for life threatening situations like fluid overload - pulmonary edema, uremic syndrome, hyperkalemia, cardiac arrythmias, electrolytes, EKG.If CKD staging is performed using a combination of kidney damage (albuminuria) and function (GFR), and represent those with more severe disease and thus higher risk for progression and complications. Cause of CKD is essential part of assessment and is an indicator of prognosis. Assessment for kidney damage (albuminuria, urinary sediments, imaging changes, biopsy findings of glomerular, vascular or tubulointerstial disease, history of kidney transplantation even if normal kidney funciton is CKD). Kidney function - GFR is the best indicator and decling GFR is hallmark of progressive CKD. < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 is diagnostics, < 15 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or treatment by dialysis is kidney failure. CKD classification is based on etiology, GFR stages (6 sub categories G1 >= 90, G2 60 to 89, G3a 45 to 59, G3b 30 to 44, G4 15 to 29, G5 < 15), Albuminuria stages (A1 < 30, A2 30 to 300, A3 > 300). Plan: Is highly varied and depends on the stage and cause of disease. Many early stage may not need a specialist. CKD management is to reduce progression. Prognosis: depends on stage and cause, optimal management can slow down progression with good prognosis."

4098292000,Antiphospholipid syndrome,"Overview: (APS) Autoimmune disorder that makes antibodies attacking phospholipids. The immune system mistakenly produces antibodies that makes blood much more likely to clot. Causes dangerous blood clots in the legs, kidneys, lungs and brain. In pregnant women, can result in miscarriage and stillbirthPresentation: Blood clots in your legs (DVT). Repeated miscarriages or stillbirths. Stroke. Transient ischemic attack (TIA).Rash - red rash with a lacy, net-like patternAssessment:To confirm a diagnosis, the presence of anti-phospholipid autoantibodies (aPL).(aPL) must appear at least twice, in tests conducted 12 or more weeks apart. Plan: Blood-thinning medications Prognosis: No cure for antiphospholipid syndrome, but medications can reduce risk of blood clots. Can lead to permanent organ damage or death if continue to have thrombotic events. APS has a genetic component, although there is not a direct transmission from parent to offspring."

4137275000,Vasculitis,"Overview: (plural: vasculitides) are serious and sometimes fatal diseases that require prompt recognition and therapy. They are defined by the presence of inflammatory leukocytes in vessel walls (sign of inflammation) with reactive damage to mural structures that may lead to compromised lumen with restriction of blood flow to tissues and associated acute or chronic organ/tissue damage. Also known as angiitis and arteritis - the naming conventions are changing with eponyms being replaced. Most important recent name changes include 'eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis EGPA' for Churg-Strauss syndrome; 'granulomatosis with polyangiitis GPA' for Wegener's granulomatosis; 'immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis IgAV' for Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP); 'anti-C1q vasculitis' for 'hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis'; 'cryoglobulinemic vasculitis' for essential cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) includes three disorders - microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), GPA, and EGPA. Non-infectious vasculitides are classified primarily by the predominant vessel involved - although some forms of vasculitis may not show predilection to one vessel type. Large Vessel Vasculitis (Takayasu’s arteritis, Giant cell arteritis); Medium vessel arteritis (polyarteritis nodosa, Kawasaki disease - mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome); Small vessel vasculitis (ANCA associated vasculitis, MPA (GPA, EGPA), Immune complex small vessel vasculitis (anti glomerular basement membrane disease - GBM, Cryoglobulinemic, IgA, anti-C1a; variable vessel (Behçet , Cogan). Single organ cutaneous vasculitis (Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis) is a syndrome defined as a single-organ, skin-isolated small vessel vasculitis or angiitis, without systemic vasculitis or glomerulonephritis i.e. without the involvement of other organ systems such as the heart, lungs, GI system, kidney or arthritis - and may be due to medication exposure (common etiology) such as penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides (including most loop and thiazide-type diuretics), phenytoin, and allopurinol, or infections such as Hepatitis B/C, HIV, chronic bacteremias like endocarditis, shunts. Kawasaki's, aka mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome is a vasculitides of childhood (rare in adults), typically self-limited with fever and inflammation lasting about 2 weeks without therapy, but may lead to complications such as coronary artery aneurysms, heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrythmia, peripheral arterial occlusion. Henoch-Schönlein purpura is the most common form of systemic vasculitis in children, a primarily pediatric condition that is an IgA mediated vasculitis most commonly seen in ages 3-15 years, with predominant occurrence in winter often one to two weeks after a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Presentation: Vasculitis is rare but should be considered in patients who present with systemic or constitutional symptoms in combination with evidence of single and/or multiorgan dysfunction. Include, fever, headache, fatigue, wt loss, general aches and pains, night sweats, rash, numbness or weakness. Behçet is associated with painful, recurrent oral ulcers M > F. Kawasaki has fever (> 5 days) with signs of mucocutaneous inflammation (fissured lips, injected pharynx, strawberry tongue, mucositis), bilateral bulbar conjunctival injection, erythema of palms or soles, edema, desquamation of periungual areas, polymorphous rash, cervical lymphadenopathy, arthritis. Henoch-Schönlein purpura is characterized by tetrad of manifestations of palpable purpura (raised purple lesions, symmetrically distributed over legs and buttocks, trunk usually spared) in patients with neither thrombocytopenia nor coagulopathy, arthritis/arthralgia, abdominal pain and renal disease. Assessment: C-reactive protein, CBC, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies test, urinalysis, x-rays, ultrasound, CT, MRI, PET, angiography, biopsy (affected area). Plan: Control the inflammation and resolve underlying disease triggering the vasculitis. If due to external exposure, identify and discontinue. Remission induction and remission maintenance using corticosteroids, steroid-sparing meds. Disease specific treatments are possible for some sub-types. Maintenance may include surgery if vasculitis caused an aneurysm or blocked arteries. Prognosis: Limited data. Depends on type of vasculitis and organs involved and how serious. Some initial success with treatment, some have flare-ups, and some vasculitis does not go away and requires ongoing treatment. IVIG for Kawasaki’s may reduce complications such as coronary artery aneurysm. Henoch-Schönlein purpura is typically self limited."
4139034000,Immune reconstitution syndrome,"Overview: abbreviated IRIS. a collection of inflammatory disorders associated with paradoxical worsening of preexisting infectious processes following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected individuals. Synonyms - Immune recovery disease, Immune reconstitution disease, Immune reconstitution syndrome, Immune restoration disease, Immune rebound illness, Steroid-withdrawal disease, Immunorestitution disease, Immune response reactions. There is no universally agreed-upon definition for the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). However, it is generally accepted that the diagnosis of IRIS requires the worsening of a recognized (""paradoxical"" IRIS) or unrecognized preexisting infection (""unmasking"" IRIS) in the setting of improving immunologic function. Presentation: Symptoms associated with prior infections at the site of pre-existing infection (for example, people with HIV on ART who were previously treated for pulmonary tuberculosis may have new fevers, malaise, weight loss and worsening respiratory symptoms). Multiple infections previously cleared by the patient can be the culprit: cryptococcus, CMV, JC virus, pneumocystis, Hepatitis B and C, for example. Assessment: Distinguish from active infection with history and physical examination, including opportunistic infections. Plan: Supportive care and glucocorticoids may be needed for severe symptoms. Treat for opportunistic infections if indicated. Continue ART. Prognosis: Usually self-limited with good prognosis."
4163261000,Prostate cancer,"Overview: A cancer in a man's prostate, a small walnut-sized gland that produces seminal fluid. Prostate cancer begins when cells in the prostate gland start to grow out of control. Presentation: Difficulty with urination, trouble urinating, decreased force in the stream of urine, blood in semen, discomfort in the pelvic area, bone pain, and erectile dysfunction. Sometimes there are no symptoms at all. Assessment: The prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test and digital rectal examination (DRE) are two tests that are used to screen for prostate cancer. Only a biopsy can confirm the presence and type of cancer. Plan: In some of these cases, monitoring is recommended. Other types are aggressive and require radiation, surgery, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, or other treatments. Prognosis: Males with early stage prostate cancer have a good chance of effective treatment and survival. The 5-year survival rate for most men with local or regional prostate cancer is nearly 100%. For men diagnosed with prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 31%. The 10-year survival rate for local, regional, and distant prostate cancer combined is 98%."

4185932000,Ischemic heart disease,"Overview: Ischemic heart disease includes acute (unstable), chronic (stable) and acute on chronic (unstable) ischemic heart disease. Chronic coronary syndrome, stable ischemic heart disease, coronary heart disease, coronary artery disease, are terms used to describe a syndrome due to inadequate supply of blood to the myocardium due to obstruction of the epicardial coronary arteries, usually from atherosclerosis (arteriosclerosis is vessel narrowing, hardening. atherosclerosis is a subtype of arteriosclerosis due to cholestrol plaque). This is distinct from Acute Coronary syndrome (acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina). Although a few people in this category may have acute (unstable) disease, the vast majority have a chronic (stable) disease - stable ischemic heart disease. Unless otherwise specified, this phenotype describes individuals with such chronic stable disease. While some may have history of prior myocardial infaction, others may have had silent infarction of heart that was incidentally found. An important subtype is left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) and is a diagnosis made via coronary arteriography, and maybe suggested based on ECG pattern on stress testing. Left main equivalent disease, defined as severe (≥70 percent) proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and proximal left circumflex disease. Presentation: People with this disease may have Angina pectoris, chest discomfort that occurs predictably and reproducibly at a certain level of exertion and is relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. Many maybe asymptomatic with symptoms only detected in stress testing. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia frequently present. Assessment: extent and severity of coronary disease can be assessed by stress testing, cardiac imaging, and angiography. history or pathologic Q waves on an electrocardiogram, or wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram may help identify old myocardial infarction. Plan: secure the diagnosis, assess the extent of disease, relieve symptoms, and prevent future cardiac events such as acute coronary syndromes. Risk reduction (control of hypertension, lipids, weight loss, control of diabetes, exercise, antiplatelet therapy), antianginal therapy use of nitrites. Decrease cardiac demands with calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, supportive care. If LMCAD is detected, strong consider revascularization including coronary artery bypass graft. Prognosis: Coronary artery disease can lead to fatal myocardial infarction without adequate management. Most patients with significant LMCAD are symptomatic and are at higher risk of cardiovascular events, without revascularization, three-year survival is as low as 30% - CABG is recommended over PCI (controversial)."

Presentation: progressive symptoms of dyspnea, increasing oxygen requirement, alveolar infiltrates on chest imaging within 72 hours of symptoms. In addition to respiratory symptoms, symptoms of inciting agent such as sepsis, trauma, smoke inhalation, pneumonia, inflammatory or autoimmune conditions, vasculitis etc. The presence of cardiac failure or fluid overload should not fully explain the symptoms. Assessment: physical exam, chest imaging, rule out cardiac causes (cardio pulmonary edema) with EKG +/- echo, BNP. Look for etiology/inciting agent. Bronchoscopy. Plan: Supportive care with management of hypoxemia with supplemental oxygenation including mechanical ventillation if needed. Sedation and analgesia if needed for ventillation. Hemodynamic monitoring and support. Glucose control. DVT prophylaxis. Infection control and prevention. Identify and remove inciting agent. Prognosis: in short term may be progressive with complications if inciting agent is not removed. Complications may arise from mechanical ventillation. Delirium of critically ill may occur. In past had high mortality rate of about 50%, but has now declined. In long term, patients may have experience sequela from such complications or tissue injury."
4212540000,Chronic liver disease,"Overview: Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) is a hetergenous group of long standing liver diseases with similar presentation, all characterized by progressive destruction of liver function (clotting factors, albumin, metabolism and excretion of bile) over many months (?6 months) - common to all CLD is continuous process of inflammation, destruction and regeneration of liver parenchyma leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. The etiology for CLD is broad to include alcoholic liver disease (including alcoholic fatty liver, alcohol hepatitis), non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD NASH), Chronic Viral Hepatitis (B, C, D), genetic (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency esp children, hereditary hemochromatosis - excessive iron abosrption, wilsons disease - copper accumulation), automimmune causes (primary biliar cirrhosis PBC, primary sclerosing cholangitis PSC, autoimmune hepatitis AIH), long term drug exposure (amiodarone, isoniazid, methotrexate, phenytoin, nitrofurantoin), Vascular (Budd chiari syndrome). It may also be due to idiopathic or cryptogenic reasons. Presentation: highly variable and depends on the degree of destruction of liver function - but most commonly asymptomatic and detected incidentally or during screening (e.g. hepatitis). Hepatitis may occassionally be associated non specific right upper quadrant pain or discomfort. Most commonly patients are found to have mild elevated liver enzymes on screening test, that when further evaluated leads to etiologic diagnosis. Decompesation (e.g. chronic liver failure) is associated with portal hypertension (variceal bleeding, hematemesis, melena), thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, jaundice - ascities with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatitic encephalopathy (lactulose/rifampin). Primary sclerosing cholangitis has cholestatic pattern (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, abrnomal bile ducts thickening, dilataion, strictures). Assessment: livery biopsy is considered gold standard to measure fibrosis and cirrhosis, but is now increasingly being replaced by non invasive methods (elastrography). Screen for viral hepatitis. Liver ultrasound. Plan: find the etiology and treat the cause where possible. e.g. antiviral, hep C - 3 months negative = cure. Cirrhosis - prevent decompensation. Autoimmune - induce remission (steroids, azathioprine). Decompensated cirrhosis - liver transplantation."

Whenever possible, such patients are managed in the ICU with access to centers with active liver transplanation program. Presentation: Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, diarrhea; yellowed skin and eyes (jaundice) along with belly pain and swelling; mental confusion (hepatic encephalopathy), easy bruising or bleeding. Assessment: serial laboratory tests are essential to monitor disease courese - monitor serum aminotransferases, bilirubin, hypoglycemia, electrolyte (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia), ammonia. Find the cause of liver injury . Plan: if acetaminophen poisoning, N-acetylcysteine. Bleeding prevention because of coagulopaty from failure of liver to synthesize clotting factors. Infection surveillance and prevention. Nutrition support in ICU. Mushroom amanita phalloides ingestion position treatment activated charcoal. Budd-chiari syndrome - transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement. Prognosis: medical emergency, and poor prognosis especially in the care at specialized centers - only minority will resolve spontaneously. Survial also depends on ensuing complications and its prevention/management."
4246127000,Liver cancer,"Overview: Hepatic cancer. Most common type of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma, which begins in the main type of liver cell (hepatocyte). Other types of liver cancer, such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatoblastoma, are much less common. Most liver cancers have links to cirrhosis. Presentation: Early stages of primary liver cancer (no symptoms).

437222000,Respiratory syncytial virus infection,"Overview: RSV, is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be serious, especially for infants and older adults. Severe RSV disease is #1 reason infants under 1 year of age are hospitalized in the USPresentation: Runny nose, decrease in appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever, and wheezing. Show symptoms within 4 to 6 days after getting infected. Assessment: Mild RSV symptoms are similar to the common cold, testing usually isn't required for diagnosis. However, there are some lab tests to confirm diagnosis, the most common is a mouth swab or a blood test to check white blood cell counts and look for viruses. In severe RSV cases that require hospitalization, additional testing may be needed. Imaging tests, such as a chest X-ray or CT scan can check for lung complications. Blood and urine cultures may be necessary when infants are very sick, as RSV-related bronchiolitis can occur with a urinary tract infection in newborns. Plan: No specific treatment for RSV infection, though researchers are working to develop vaccines and antivirals. Manage fever and pain with OTC fever reducers and pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. There are currently only two drugs approved - Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody for the prevention of RSV in high-risk children and ribavirin is approved for treatment of severe RSV disease. Prognosis: Most RSV infections go away on their own in a week or two. But some people with RSV infection, especially infants younger than 6 months of age and older adults, may need to be hospitalized if they are having trouble breathing or are dehydrated. In most of these cases, hospitalization only lasts a few days."

Addiction is a chronic brain disease that causes a person to compulsively seek out drugs, even though they cause harm. Presentation: craving, sweating, general discontent, chronic constipation, physical substance dependenceAssessment: Inability to control opioid use, self-diagnosable Plan: Medications such as methadone can help alleviate the symptoms of withdrawal and cravings. Pairing medication with inpatient or support programs generally has the most success. Prognosis: Can be managed successfully."
438130000,Opioid abuse,"Overview: Opioid use disorder. Misuse of opioids. Opioids, are called narcotics. They include strong prescription pain relievers, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid.

Usually asymptomaic, but significant end-organ dysfunction, e.g. proteinuria maybe present. Pre-eclampsia commonly occurs in last half of pregnancy and in postpartum period. If the women was hypertensive prior to pregnancy, then it is consider preeclampsia superimposed on hypertenson. Sign of end organ damage such as protienuria is needed for diagnosis, hypertension in the absence of such an evidence of end organ damage may be considered gestational hypertension. Presentation: is non specific and requires a high degree of suspicion. symptoms may include headache, epigastric pain, oliguria, peripheral edema. Risk of HELLP syndrome. Plan: check blood pressure and signs of end organ damage. Severe preeclampsia is an indication for induced delivery. The cure for preeclampsia is delivery of the fetus if the disease becomes severe (showing early signs of end organ damage). Monitoring of amniotic fluid index, nonstress testing, fetal biometry to monitor for intrauterin growth restriction. management of blood pressure with antihypertensives such as nifedipine or labetalol. If pre-eclampsia develops severe features, admit and treat with MgSO4 for convulvion prophylaxis. Prognosis: can progress to eclampsia which may be fatal. Disease is considered progressive during pregnancy and early post partum period. Sequelae of pre-eclampsia can include small for dates baby, preterm birth, HELLP syndrome, seizures, death. Careful monitoring of blood pressure and urine throughout pregnancy allows for early intervention to mitigate risk."
439727000,Human immunodeficiency virus infection,"Overview: HIV infections may be caused by one of two retroviruses, HIV-1 or HIV-2. HIV causes AIDS and interferes with the body's ability to fight infections. The virus can be transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen, or vaginal fluids. Presentation: Flu-like symptoms such as fever, sore throat, and fatigue, swollen lymph nodes. Then the disease is usually asymptomatic until it progresses to AIDS. AIDS symptoms include weight loss, fever or night sweats, fatigue, and recurrent infections. Assessment: Signs and symptoms, history. CD4 count, viral count. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 count falls below 200 cells per microliter of blood or when extreme wasting or certain serious opportunistic infections or cancers develop. Plan: Prevention and screening. Antiretroviral drugs, prevent opportunistic infections, relieve symptoms Prognosis: Exposure to HIV does not always lead to infection, and some people who have had repeated exposures over many years remain uninfected. No effective HIV vaccine to prevent HIV infection or slow the progression of AIDS in people who are already infected. No cure exists for AIDS, but strict adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) can dramatically slow the disease's progress, prevent secondary infections and complications, and prolong life."

440417000,Pulmonary embolism,"Overview: Pulmonary embolus (PE) refers to obstruction/blockade of pulmonary artery or one of its branches by material (eg, thrombus, tumor, air, or fat) that originated elsewhere in the body (embolism). Temporally PE is classified into acute (presenting immediately after obstruction), subacute (within days or weeks following event), chronic (over many years, ie, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; CTEPH - uncommon). Unless otherwise specified, the general useage of the term pulmonary embolism implies 'acute' PE. Acute PE is further classified based on hemodynamic stability into unstable/massive/high-risk PE if hemodynamically unstable (hypotension), hemodynamically stable with right ventricular strain submassive/intermediate-risk PE, hemodynamically stable and no evidence of right ventricular strain low-risk PE. It is also classified based on the location of the emboli - saddle PE, main lobar, segmental or subsegmental. Most emboli are thought to originate from lower extremity proximal veins (iliac, femoral, and popliteal). Presentation: Highly variable and may occassionally be asymptomatic and found incidentally (especially chronic variant). Most commonly starts with a combination of chest pain (classically pleuritic in nature), cough, and symptoms of deep venous thrombosis. The symptoms of PE are secondary to pathophysiologic responses like tissue infarction, abnormal gas exchange, cardivascular compromise with sudden shortness of breath and chest pain - to shock and death. Assessment: Hard diagnosis in hemodynamically stable patients - often guided by prior probability based on at-risk (Wells criteria). D-dimer testing and definitive diagnostic imaging (CT pulmonary angiography). V/Q scan is less commonly used. If hemodynamically unstable, definitive diagnostic imaging may not be practical or safe. Plan: If hemodynamically unstable, resusistative efforts (oxygenation, stabilization, ventillatory support, hemodynamic support). Once diagnosis is confirmed, main therapy is anticoagulants (sometimes started prior to diagnosis when pretest probability is high). If the emboli is considered life threatening, then thrombolysis, inferior vena cava filters, or embolectomy surgery. Prognosis: Death may occur, but mortality is reduced with anticoagulation. Adequate long-term management may reduce recurrence of thromboembolism - better prognosis."

Motor component - muscles of mastication and tensor tympani of middle ear hearing. Most commonly disorder is Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) TN - mainly due to compression of the trigeminal nerve root, demyelination (multiple sclerosis). Trigemenial nerve disorder may also present without pain, e.g. trigeminal neuropathy with sensory loss on the face, with weakness of muscles of masticatio- deviation of jaw on opening. Presentation: TN is characterized by recurrent brief episodes of excruciating unilateral electric shock like pain in the lips, gums, cheek or chin. TN is mosstly clustered among middle-aged and elderly persons are affected, with ~ 60% in women. Assessment: TN is a clinical diagnosis - but detailed investigation using neuroimaging to identify cause. Rule out herpes zoster, post traumatic. Plan: carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine is first line. Gabapentin for non responders. Lidocaine, phenytoin for rescue therapy. Occassionally surgery (gamma knife radiosurgery, rhizotomy, microvascular decompression).

440940000,Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection,"Overview: A group of Gram-positive bacteria that are genetically distinct from other strains of Staphylococcus aureus. MRSA is responsible for several difficult-to-treat infections in humans. (MRSA) infection is caused by a type of staph bacteria that's become resistant to many of the antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph infections. Most MRSA infections occur in people who've been in hospitals or other health care settings, such as nursing homes and dialysis centers. When it occurs in these settings, it's known as health care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA). Presentation: Depends on the part of the body that is infected. Staph skin infection - present with fever, swollen, painful red bumps that are warm to touch, can be full of pus or other drainage - turn into painful abscesses or burrow deep into the body (life-threatening infections)Assessment: Checking a tissue sample or nasal secretions for signs of drug-resistant bacteriaPlan: Antibiotics (IV), if skin boil - incisions and drainage; culturesPrognosis: MRSA infections can resist the effects of many common antibiotics, so they are more difficult to treat. This can allow the infections to spread and sometimes become life-threatening. MRSA is usually spread in the community by contact with infected people or things that are carrying the bacteria. Once the active infection goes away, you can still have MRSA on your skin and in the nose (MRSA carrier)."
441284000,Open-angle glaucoma,"Overview: The angle in your eye where the iris meets the cornea is as wide and open as it should be, but the eye's drainage canals become clogged over time, causing an increase in internal eye pressure and subsequent damage to the optic nervePresentation: Typically no early warning signs or painful symptoms. By the time a patient is aware of vision loss, the disease is usually quite advanced. Early on, start to lose peripheral vision. Assessment: Eye examinations, check eye pressure, measure cornea thickness Plan: Can’t fix damage to the optic nerve or the vision problems that follow. Need to slow glaucoma’s progress down - prostaglandins, beta-blockers. laser therapy or surgery. Prognosis: Without treatment, glaucoma can lead to blindness. No cure for glaucoma, gets worse over time."
441788000,Human papilloma virus infection,"Overview: Most common sexually transmitted infection (STI), viral infection. HPV infection occurs when the virus enters the body, usually through a cut, abrasion or small tear in your skin. The virus is transferred primarily by skin-to-skin contact.

Warts appear depending on which kind of HPV is involved - genital warts, hands/fingers, plantar, or face Assessment: Appearance of warts, but if not present - Vinegar (acetic acid) solution test, pap test, DNA test Plan: Medication applied directly to the warts. Cryotherapy, electrocautery, surgical removal/laser surgery. HPV vaccines (protect against cervical cancer and genital warts). If HPV in the cervix - colposcopy and biopsy. Prognosis: Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by HPV infections. Warts often go away without treatment, particularly in children. There's no cure for the virus, so they can reappear in the same place or other places."

PE can present as hard to breathe and tachycardia, chest pain, and dizzinessAssessment: D-dimer (blood test), duplex ultrasound (leg or arm), for PE - pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas, CXR, CT, and Ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scan, Pulmonary angiogramPlan: Anticoagulants, thrombin inhibitors, clot-busting meds (thrombolytics) like tPA (tissue plasminogen activator), sometimes surgery (filter into a vein)Prognosis: Dangerous but treatable. The risk of developing VTE is highest after major surgery or a major injury, or when you have heart failure, cancer, or a heart attack."
444429000,Herpes simplex virus,"Overview: A sexually transmitted infection, herpes simplex virus 1 (oral herpes) and 2 (genital herpes). HSV-1 and HSV-2 are common and contagious. Presentation: A blister or multiple blisters (can be painful) on or around affected areas -- usually the mouth, genitals, or rectum. Can be asymptomatic. Assessment: physical exam, (usually no testing needed to confirm dx), viral culture, PCR test (presence and type of HSV), HSV antibodies (blood)Plan: Relieve symptoms, no cure. Antiviral medications. Prognosis: Lifelong infection. Recurrent outbreaks may vary in frequency and severity."
44784217000,Cardiac arrhythmia,"Overview: Normal sinus heart rate originates from the sinus node 60-100 beats (sinus arrythmia -normal arrythmia, sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia). An arrhythmia is any rhythm that is not normal sinus rhythm with normal atrioventricular (AV) conduction. Arrythmias are classified in many ways based on rate - tachyarrhythmias vs bradyarrhythmias, regularity (regular vs irregular), location/type of origin (atrial vs ventricular, reentrant), or based on wall motion (flutter vs fibrillation). Common arrythmias (supraventricular - atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, non sinus atrial trachycardia ectopic/reentry/premature beats), AV junction (reentry tachycardia, extrasystoles), Ventricular (sustained/non sustained tachycaria, fibrillation, extrasystole/premature beats). Presentation: Symptom type and severity depends on the type, etiology and rate of arrythmia - symptoms dictates urgency of presentation. Sensation of palpitations, syncope, lightheadedness or dizziness, poor exercise tolerance. Assessment: ECG, Holter ambulatory monitor, CBC to rule out anemia, TSH to rule out thyroid disease, lipids, liver tests, clotting tests, electrolyte CMP especially potassium, BNP to evaluate heart failure, echocardiogram to evaluate for structural heart disease. Plan: Treated according to location of the pathology including medications, pacemaker, defibrillator, radiofrequency catheter ablation, external cardioversion - conversion to sinus rythym, vagal maneuver for sinus tachycardias. Treatment of underlying disease such as anemia or thyrotoxicosis frequently resolves the arrhythmia. Prognosis: When identified early in the course of disease process, good. If not treated, can lead to increased risk of stroke (due to atrial fibrillation), heart failure, death. Specialist involvement recommended for anti arrythmic drug management."
45763653000,Fracture of bone of hip region,"Overview: Hip fractures occur when a person breaks the bone between the pelvis and knee and these fractures are known as femoral-neck fractures or intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric fractures. Presentation: With hip fractures patients will often complain of severe hip pain and are unable to walk. The physical examination commonly reveals an abducted and externally rotated hip with leg-length discrepancy. Assessment: Hip fractures are generally done with x-ray but an MRI or bone scan could look for hairline fractures. Plan: Treatment usually involves a combination of surgery, rehabilitation, and medication. The surgical options include internal repair using screws, total hip replacement, and partial hip replacement. Prognosis: A hip fracture is a serious injury with complications that can be life-threatening. Hip fracture has an overall 1-year mortality rate that varies from 14% to 36% among patients aged 65 or above, especially after 5 to 10 years after fracture, and in addition, the survivors have a shorter life expectancy."
73553000,Arthropathy,Overview: Presentation: Assessment: Plan: Prognosis:
80182000,Dermatomyositis,"Overview: Autoimmune condition that causes skin changes and muscle weakness (idiopathic inflammatory myopathy). Unknown cause. Presentation: Red skin rash around the eyelids, red bumps around the joints (Gottron papules), arm and leg muscle weakness, joint pain. Assessment: Clinical exam, blood analysis - creatine kinase (CK) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), autoantibodies; skin or muscle biopsy, Electromyography (EMG), MRI to scan muscles. Plan: Manage symptoms - corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, physical therapy, and exercise. Prognosis: Symptom improvement. Chronic - can last for years or be lifelong. Muscle weakness gets worse over time and leads to stiff joints and muscle wasting."
80204000,Fetal growth restriction,"Overview: aka - intrauterine growth restriction IUGR. When a fetus fails to reach it's biological growth potential due to environmental factors including placental dysfunction. There is discrepancies between actual and expected sonographic biometric measurements for a given gestational age. Traditionally, it has been defined as <10th percentile weight for gestational age on a singleton growth curve, as this establishes the diagnosis as being small for gestational age (SGA). Distinct from ""small for gestational age"" (which is caused by constitutionally small fetus or congenital/intrinsic non environmental fetal causes). Presentation: Most commonly detected in natal ultrasound - mismatch between pregnancy dates and fetal growth on ultrasound. sometimes associated with inadequate weight gain during pregnancy. Assessment: Serial ultrasounds to evaluate the fetus, placenta, amniotic fluid index, and umbilical artery dopplers. Plan: find the cause. Genetic causes. Evaluate for infections. Antiphospholipid syndrome. Manage reversible causes of growth restriction (stop smoking, treat infections), nonstress testing, correct nutritional deficiencies such as iron, treat any infections present, treat high blood pressure. Prognosis: If umbilical artery function critically low, preterm delivery is indicated. Can result in intrauterine fetal demise. Stillbirth, neonatal death, neonatal morbidity, and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome in perinatal region. Long-term as child grows, commonly associated with cardiovascular, metabolic endocrine disease/dysfunction."
80502000,Osteoporosis,"Overview: Porous bone. A bone disease that occurs when the body loses too much bone, makes too little bone, or both. As a result, bones become weak and may break from a fall or, in serious cases, from sneezing or minor bumps. Risk factors for osteoporosis include aging, being female, low body weight, low sex hormones or menopause, smoking, and some medications. Presentation: Silent disease. Breaking a bone is often the first sign or may notice getting shorter or upper back is curving forward. Assessment: Bone density test - DEXA scan (diagnose bone loss), and imaging Plan: Prevention and treatment include calcium and vitamin D, exercise, and osteoporosis medications - BisphosphonatesPrognosis: Important to prevent falls and fractures. Is good if bone loss is detected in the early phases and proper intervention is undertaken."
81902000,Urinary tract infectious disease,"Overview: Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). An infection in any part of the urinary system, the kidneys, bladder, or urethra. Occurs when bacteria enters the urinary tract through the urethra and begin to multiply in the bladder. Presentation: strong urge to urinate, burning sensation when urinating, cloudy/can be red/pink urine, urinary frequency, pelvic pain in women. (depends too on whihc part of the urinary tract is infected - acute pyelonephritis, cyctitis, urethritis). Assessment: Urinalysis, urine culture, if frequent infections or abnormality in urinary tract = ultrasound, CT, MRI, or cystoscopy. Plan: Antibiotics, analgesics (relieve burning) Prognosis: Symptoms clear up within a few days of treatment"
